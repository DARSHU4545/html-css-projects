        <h1>REPUBLIC DAY</h1>
        <p>Republic Day is a public holiday in India where the country marks and celebrates the date on which the
            Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950. This replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as
            the governing document of India, thus turning the nation into a republic separate from British Raj.26th
            January is celebrated as Republic Day in our country. On this day in 1950, the constitution of our country
            was formally adopted and India became a fully sovereign state. The fundamental law of the country, the
            Constitution, was enacted out of the diligence and hard work of great men like Mahatma Gandhi and the
            numerous freedom fighters who fought and sacrificed their lives for the independence of our country. So, the
            26th of January was declared a National holiday and has been recognized and celebrated as the Republic Day
            of India ever since.

        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p> After Independence, the country did not have any self-made official Constitution, instead, its laws were
            based on modified colonial acts. So, establishing an official constitution for our own country was the
            utmost task in front of the Government of India. Our constitution is the result of the hard work and
            struggle of the esteemed members of the Constituent Assembly under the Presidency of Dr. Rajendra Prasad.
            Dr. Ambedkar was the Father of our Constitution. After deeply studying the various constitutions of other
            countries, our founding fathers framed our Constitution and it is the lengthiest constitution in the world.
            It reflects upon the dedication and foresight of these great men. That is how the Constitution came into
            being. It took two years, eleven months, and eighteen days to complete the Constitution. Though it was
            enacted and adopted by the constituent assembly on 26th November 1949, it came into force on 26th January,
            1950.

        <h1> Significance of 26th January</h1>
        <p> It is to be noted that January 26 had a great significance in Indias struggle for Swaraj. The Congress
            Session at Lahore on December 29, 1929, had passed a resolution declaring Purna Swaraj (Complete
            Independence) as Indias goal. It was also decided that the 26th of January should be observed all over
            India as Purna Swaraj Day. The complete Independence Day was for the first time celebrated on January 26th,
            1930. It continued to be so observed until 1947. On achieving Independence, August 15 became our
            Independence Day.
            January 26th, however, marked a great event in Indias struggle for freedom. It was, therefore, in the
            favour of all that January 26 should be selected as the Date of Commencement of the new Constitution.
            Therefore, this day is celebrated as a day of national significance with great joy and pride.
